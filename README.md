# motivation

i can't jam with my friends in real-world because of covid, so I'm trying to move it to online.

# usage

1. create your own jam room just like http://jamhub.io/my_band (`http://jamhub.io/:anything_will_do`)
2. copy that link and share it with friends
3. go ahead and have fun

# FAQ

- What is that?
  > jamhub is a [server](https://github.com/fletcherist/jamhub/blob/master/jamhub.go) implements midi-over-websocket protocol and web application with high-quality virtual instruments, drum loops and textures.
- Can I attach MIDI keyboard?
  > yes, you definitely can, so give it a try
- I have no sound
  > please use Google Chrome, it's the only supported browser at the moment
- My ping is high
  > use wi-fi for better performance, not mobile internet. If it doesn't help, you can easily host your own jamhub server on your vm. Create issue and I'll let you through the process. If you can't host your own server, feel free to create issue and I'll host an instance in your region.
